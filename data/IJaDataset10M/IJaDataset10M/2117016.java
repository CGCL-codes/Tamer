/**

 * after the execution completes.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The <code>JobDataMap</code> found on this object (via the
 * <code>getMergedJobDataMap()</code> method) serves as a convenience - it is
 * a merge of the <code>JobDataMap</code> found on the <code>JobDetail</code>
 * and the one found on the <code>Trigger</code>, with the value in the
 * latter overriding any same-named values in the former. <i>It is thus
 * considered a 'best practice' that the execute code of a Job retrieve data

 * into this JobDataMap to somehow be set back onto a <code>StatefulJob</code>'s
 * own JobDataMap.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <code>JobExecutionContext</code> s are also returned from the
 * <code>Scheduler.getCurrentlyExecutingJobs()</code> method. These are the
 * same instances as those past into the jobs that are currently executing
 * within the scheduler. The exception to this is when your application is using
 * Quartz remotely (i.e. via RMI) - in which case you get a clone of the
 * <code>JobExecutionContext</code>s, and their references to the
 * <code>Scheduler</code> and <code>Job</code> instances have been lost (a
 * clone of the <code>JobDetail</code> is still available - just not a handle
 * to the job instance that is running).
