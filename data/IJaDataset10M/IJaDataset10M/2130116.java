/**
 * The FilledField is the base class for all the different types of data
 * that can be stored in fields.  There will be derived classes for:
 * <UL>
 * <LI>String (rendered as a combobox with history)
 * <LI>boolean (Rendered as a checkbox)
 * </UL>
 *
 * Anything else?  Unsure.
 *
 * Not even sure if this will be necessary, since the functionality of each
 * different type will be so different.  Maybe there can be a common
 * toString() or somesuch.  Again, unsure.  So for now it's just blank.
