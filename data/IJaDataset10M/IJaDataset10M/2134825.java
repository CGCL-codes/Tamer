/**
 * A StructuralEntity represents the definition in source code of a structural entity, i.e. it
 * denotes an aspect of the state of a system. The different kinds of structural entities mainly
 * differ in lifetime: some have the same lifetime as the entity they belong to, e.g. an attribute
 * and a class, some have a lifetime that is the same as the whole system, e.g. a global variable.
 * Subclasses of this class represent different mechanisms for defining such an entity.
 * All possible variable definitions are subclasses of the class StructuralEntity.
 * StructuralEntity itself participates in the Access association.

     * language dependent issue.
