 * <p>Represents SIP addresses as found, for example, in From, To, and

 * as a user agent client (UAC) and when redirecting an incoming
 * request.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Addresses appear in a number of SIP headers and generally adhere
 * to the grammar (constituent non-terminals are defined in the SIP
 * specification, RFC 3261):
 * <pre>(name-addr / addr-spec) *(SEMI generic-param) </pre>
 * 
 * that is to say, Addresses consist of a URI, an optional display name,
 * and a set of name-value parameters.
 * 
 * <p>The <code>Address</code> interface is used to represent the value of 
 * all headers defined to contain one or more addresses as defined above.
 * Apart from From, To, and Contact, this includes
 * Route, Record-Route, Reply-To, Alert-Info, Call-Info, Error-Info,
 *  as well as extension headers like P-Asserted-Identity,
 *  P-Preferred-Identity, and Path.</p>
 *  
 *  <p><code>Address</code> objects can be constructed using one of the
 *  <code>SipFactory.createAddress</code> methods and can be obtained
 *  from messages using  {@link#SipServletMessage.getAddressHeader(java.lang.String)} and
 *  {@lin#}SipServletMessage.getAddressHeaders(java.lang.String)}.</p>
