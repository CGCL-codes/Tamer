	 * Write an application that plays "guess the number" as follows: Your application
	 * chooses the number to be guessed by selecting an integer at random in the range 
	 * 1-1000. The application than displays the following in a label:
	 * 		I have a number between 1 and 1000. Can you guess my number?
	 * 		Please enter your first guess.
	 * A JtextField should be used to input the guess. As each guess is input, the 
	 * background color should change to either red or blue. Red indicates that the user
	 * is getting "warmer," and blue indicates that the user is getting "colder." A Jlabel
	 * should display either "Too High" or "Too Low" to help the user zero in on the correct
	 * answer. When the user gets the correct answer, "Correct!" should be displayed, and the
	 * JTexField used for input should be changed to be uneditable. A JButton should be provided
	 * to allow the user to play the game again. When the JButton is clicked, a new random number 
	 * should be generated and the input JTextField changed to be editable.
