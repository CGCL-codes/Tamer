/**
 * Events sources are the source of server-side notifications, which interested

 * The DPWS framework supports two types of <a

 * href="http://www.w3.org/Submission/WS-Eventing/">WS-Eventing</a> compliant
 * events: <strong>notifications</strong> and <strong>solicit-response</strong>
 * operations. While the first ones represent one-way messages sent from the
 * event source to its subscribers, the later additionally includes response
 * messages sent back from the subscribers to the source.
 * <p>
 * Clients willing to receive notifications from this event source may simply
 * {@link #subscribe(EventListener, long, DataStructure) subscribe} to it. A
 * subscription can be defined to expire after a certain amount of time (
 * <em>duration</em>) or it may last &quot;forever&quot;, i.e. until either the
 * event source or the subscriber explicitly cancels it or it terminates due to
 * shutdown or missing network reachability.
