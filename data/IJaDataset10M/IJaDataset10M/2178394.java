/**
 * EnterpriseSecurityException is the base class for all security related exceptions. You should pass in the root cause
 * exception where possible. Constructors for classes extending EnterpriseSecurityException should be sure to call the
 * appropriate super() method in order to ensure that logging and intrusion detection occur properly.
 * <P>
 * All EnterpriseSecurityExceptions have two messages, one for the user and one for the log file. This way, a message
 * can be shown to the user that doesn't contain sensitive information or unnecessary implementation details. Meanwhile,
 * all the critical information can be included in the exception so that it gets logged.
 * <P>
 * Note that the "logMessage" for ALL EnterpriseSecurityExceptions is logged in the log file. This feature should be
 * used extensively throughout ESAPI implementations and the result is a fairly complete set of security log records.
 * ALL EnterpriseSecurityExceptions are also sent to the IntrusionDetector for use in detecting anomalous patterns of
 * application usage.
 * <P>
