/** Represents a command of a request ({@link AuRequest}).
 * Each command is unique no matter {@link #getId} is the same or not.
 *
 * <p>There are two kind of commands: global commands and component-specific
 * commands. A global command is stored in a global map (as soon as it is
 * instantiated), and it can be retrieved by invoking {@link AuRequest#getCommand(String)}.
 *
 * <p>A component-specific command is maintained by a component, and
 * can be retrieved by use of {@link org.zkoss.zk.ui.sys.ComponentCtrl#getCommand}.
 *
 * <p>A global command is extended from {@link Command}.
 * Since it is global, you have to instantiate
 * an instance at startup. A typical usage is to declare a static instance
 * of a class.
 *
 * <p>A component-specific command is extended from {@link ComponentCommand}.
 * It is not part of the global map, and it is used only if it is returned
 * by {@link org.zkoss.zk.ui.sys.ComponentCtrl#getCommand}.
