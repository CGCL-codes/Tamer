/**
 * This class provides an API that is used to represent an LDAP bind request.
 * It should be extended by subclasses that provide the logic for processing
 * specific types of bind operations (e.g., simple binds, and the various SASL
 * mechanisms).
 * <BR><BR>
 * It is strongly recommended that all bind request types which implement the
 * rebind capability be made immutable.  If this is not done, then changes made
 * to a bind request object may alter the authentication/authorization identity
 * and/or credentials associated with that request so that a rebind request
 * created from it will not match the original request used to authenticate on a
 * connection.  Note, however, that it is not threadsafe to use the same
 * {@code BindRequest} object to attempt to bind concurrently over multiple
 * connections.
 * <BR><BR>
 * Note that even though this class is marked with the @Extensible annotation
 * type, it should not be directly subclassed by third-party code.  Only the
 * {@link SASLBindRequest} subclass is actually intended to be extended by
 * third-party code.
