/**
 * A common abstraction for implementations of aggregated {@link Graphic}s.
 * The abstraction makes no assumptions as to how the <code>Graphic</code>s are
 * stored within the aggregate. For example, the <code>Graphic</code>s may be
 * stored in an array such that the <code>Graphic</code> in the zeroeth element
 * of the array is considered the front-most object and the <code>Graphic</code>
 * in the largest element of the array is considered the bottom-most object. Or, the
 * <code>Graphic</code>s may be stored in a Skiplist sorted by a unique
 * <code>Graphic</code> identifier to make adding and removing
 * <code>Graphic</code>s very efficient.
 * <p>
 * Additionally, the abstraction makes no
 * assumptions as to thread safety. If the implementations of
 * <code>Graphic</code> are to be used in a multi-threaded environment,
 * the implementation will have to address thread safety by synchronizing
 * methods or by invoking all methods from a single thread.
