/**
 * Decorators are graphics routines to beautify widgets, such as borders and backgrounds.
 * Decorators can be enabled and disabled which means that they are drawn or not. They
 * can also share the same label (state label) for a widget such that they get enabled and
 * disabled collectively. This way, widgets can disabled and enable groups of decorators
 * in their behavior routines (e.g. for mouse hover effects, or to draw a button differently
 * when pressed).
