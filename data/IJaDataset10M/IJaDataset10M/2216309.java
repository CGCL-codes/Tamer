/**
 * Monitor the progress of some lengthly operation, and allows cancelation.
 * <p>
 * This interface makes no assumption about the output device. Additionnaly, this
 * interface provides support for non-fatal warning and exception reports.
 * <p>
 * All implementations should be multi-thread safe, even the ones that provide
 * feedback to a user interface thread.
 * <p>
 * Here an example showing how to cancel:
 * <pre><code>
 *      Iterator iterator = null;
 *      try {
 *          float size = size();
 *          float position = 0;
 *          progress.started();
 *          for (iterator = iterator(); !progress.isCanceled() && iterator.hasNext(); progress.progress(++position/size)) {
 *              try {
 *                  Feature feature = (Feature) iterator.next();
 *                  visitor.visit(feature);
 *              }
 *              catch (Exception erp) {
 *                  progress.exceptionOccurred(erp);
 *              }
 *          }
 *          progress.complete();
 *      }
 *      finally {
 *          close (iterator);
 *      }
 * </code></pre>
 * Note the use of try and catch to report exceptions.
