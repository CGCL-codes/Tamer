/**
 * This is a Sample Step class which can be used as template for creating new
 * custom Step processing classes!
 * <p>
 * Please Note: The basic methods you will want to override are described below.
 * However, obviously, you are completely free to create your own methods for
 * this Step, or override other methods. For more examples, look at the code
 * from one of the provided DSpace step classes in the "org.dspace.submit.step"
 * package.
 * <P>
 * This class performs all the behind-the-scenes processing that
 * this particular step requires.  This class's methods are utilized 
 * by both the JSP-UI and the Manakin XML-UI
 * <P>
 * If you are utilizing the JSP-UI, you will also be required to create
 * a class which implements org.dspace.app.webui.submit.JSPStep, and provide
 * the necessary JSP-related methods.  There is a corresponding sample
 * of such a class at org.dspace.app.webui.submit.step.JSPSampleStep.
