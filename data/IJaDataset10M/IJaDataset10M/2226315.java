 * PlayerCharacter may have more than one of that type of CDOMObject (e.g.
 * Language, PCTemplate) and the source of that object should be tracked.
 * 
 * Using this class, an object may have only one source. If the object is
 * re-added with a second source, this will not trigger a DATA_ADDED event.
