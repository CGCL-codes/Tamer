/**
 * IERXMigration is the interface that you must implemnt to provide a migration from one version to another.
 * 
 * You should not saveChanges() on the editingcontext passed into the methods of this interface (unless it cannot be
 * avoided), because there is a transaction above you.
 * 
 * You also must be very careful of the EO operations you perform with this editing context. You may be in the process
 * of upgrading across multiple model versions, so it is possible that you model you are using may be out of sync with
 * the underlying database at the time this particular migration is being performed in the sequence. For instance, you
 * would always be running with the latest version model, but this might be migration 3 of 5 required to get your
 * database in sync with this latest model version, so the transitional model that existed when version 3 was valid may
 * no longer exist. In general, you should only do low level channel operations during migration. Though, the editing
 * context is provided here as a convenience for use under controlled circumstances if you know it will not be a
 * problem.  You can use the IERXPostMigration interface if you need to execute (in a restricted way) EO operations.
