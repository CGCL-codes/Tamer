/**
 * A simple A/C zone controller.
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * Doesn't do anything fancy, just switches on the A/C when one or more of
 * the thermostats issues the signal with the value more than 1.0, and shuts
 * it off when all the thermostats issue the signal less than -1.0. As the
 * value of the signal raises above 1.0, the dampers are being open, as it
 * falls below -1.0, the dampers are being closed.
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * <strong>Correction:</strong> those -1.0 and 1.0 not absolute, but
 * relative - they have to be adjusted depending on the A/C mode.
